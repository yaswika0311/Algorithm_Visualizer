     Blue:default  
     Yellow: Being compared
     Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
     Green: In correct position
### Controls for visualizations
     Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
     Data size ()
     Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
     Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
